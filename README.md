#AkonPHP: A web framework for web artisans.

##Description:
AkonPHP, aka Akon, is a powerful and reactive PHP web framework designed around ease of use. With easy to use routing and a dynamic webpage resolver, you can focus on getting your website
out the door as soon as possible. And with our object oriented and functional approach, you can build webpages with responsive and dynamic design in a fraction of the time. 

##Install:
Download or pull the `master` or `full` branches into your project folder, and you're ready to go!
####The `master` Branch:
This branch contains the bare bones of Akon, the resolver, DB controller, and routing. This leaves the rest to you!

####The `full` Branch:
This branch contains everything `master` has, with extra functionality, default styles, modals, etc.
